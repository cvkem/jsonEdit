#  vinzi.jsonViewer


A small swing application to view json-objects and json-files in a viewer. 

(defn jsonViewer [json] ...)
The argument should be an in-memory Json-object. Internally it will be transformed to a jsonZipper.

(defn jsonFileViewer [name]  ...)
Opens the file 'name' and shows the json-contents in the viewer.

TO DO:  add buttons to modify the file (or object) and to store it again.

NOTE: When using the jsonZip libray a json object is represented by splitting each map in a set of basic elements, while all compound elements (maps and vectors) are stored in a vector with key :jsonChildren. Vectors are stored as a map with only one key { :jsonChildren  [...] }
The (original) keys and path-strings are stored in the metadata as :json/key  and :json/path. Internally the next two routines are used to transform between these two representations.
